# Remaining Controller Files Structure

The following Python controller files need to be implemented to complete the system:

## 1. controllers/light_controller.py
This file manages the 7 light zones, schedules, and light relay control.

## 2. controllers/environment_controller.py
This file handles CO2 injection, humidity control, and environmental parameters.

## 3. controllers/nutrient_controller.py
This file manages nutrient dosing, pH adjustment, and EC maintenance.

## 4. controllers/watering_controller.py
This file controls the irrigation system, watering schedules, and pump activation.

## 5. controllers/sensor_manager.py
This file interfaces with all physical sensors and provides readings to the system.

Each controller follows a similar pattern with the following methods:
- __init__(): Initializes controller with database and socket connections
- update(): Regular update method called from the main loop
- get_settings(): Returns current controller settings
- update_settings(): Updates controller settings
- manual_control(): Handles manual control commands

These controllers should be implemented according to your specific hardware setup, sensor connections, and control requirements. The basic structure has been provided in the previous files.
